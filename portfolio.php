                       <h2>Scenario:</h2>
                    <p>
                        In January 2017 I was brought onto the Rizepoint marketing team to help with a total site redesign and build.
                        <br><br>
                        Rizepoint is a corporate compliance software company. Their products are used across many industries to manage brand, keep products within regulated parameters and maintain internal QA standards.
                        <br><br>
                        Rizepoint was seeking a site redesign, as their active website was not acting to the capacity desired. Users weren't utilizing the tools the site provided. Potential customers weren't finding information about the product and they were leaving the site after only a short time.
                        <br><br>
                        Key to the redesign was that the website would operate as a salesman to potential clients. Every part of the site was considered, studied and tested to maximize user engagement, retention and action.

            <div class="mb-wrapper">
                <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 stats">

                        <h1>In Depth Review:</h1>

                       <h2>Navigation:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Studies of the analytics and interviews showed that the main navigation was not performing as intended.
                        <br><br>
                        Menus were reassigned to three key categories that targeted different user types: Clients, potential clients and information. 
                        <br><br>
                        The solutions tab was renamed to industries, this was in an effort to attract new clients within those verticals. Users unique fields were to be front and center across the whole site. The industries tab makes it very clear where our market values were strongest.

        <section class="section2">  
            <div class="cont">

                    <p>
                        Under the original solutions tab was information about Rizepoint’s products. User research showed that they were confused by both the naming and separate nature of the products. To alleviate that concern a single page was built to display and explain the features and differences between the product. In the navigation each section was linked via anchor tabs.
                        <br><br>
                        Resources was add to give current and potential users access to wide breadth of case studies, awards and news about the company and the product.
                        <br><br>
                        The company tab was carried over from the initial design, but cleaned up to give those looking for more about Rizepoint a healthy dose of information on the team, executives, and careers.
                        <br><br>
                        A common complaint amongst users and clients was a lack of pricing on the site. A tab was provided so that information could be easily accessed from anywhere on the site.

                    <p>
                        The original site was confusing to users. Information was clustered too tightly. Content wasn’t connected with any specific goal, it was just there to fill the page. Barely anyone was getting past the fold.
                        <br><br>
                        The redesign focused on a bold color scheme, a minimal layout and more interactivity. Every piece of content designed was to serve the greater goal of informing users with information they wanted.
                        <br><br>
                        New color combinations and gradients were created to beautify the site and work as a sort of soft rebrand.
                        <br><br>
                        Visual queues were developed to direct users to content that was most important. We utilized video, modals, user personas and visual psychology to improve user engagement promote longer sessions.
